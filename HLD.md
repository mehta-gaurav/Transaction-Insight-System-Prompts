# Transaction Insight System - High Level Design

### üìå Project Objective
Design and implement a **Transaction Insight System** as a scalable, maintainable, and well-structured backend solution. It should enable financial organizations to efficiently query, filter, and analyze large volumes of financial transactions in real time with minimal latency.

---

### üìå Problem Statement
The system must allow users to:
- Query and list hundreds to thousands of financial transactions efficiently.
- Apply multiple dynamic filters (supporting up to hundreds of filtering parameters).
- Define and save ‚ÄúTransaction Selection Sets‚Äù for reusable transaction queries.
- Use pre-saved ‚ÄúTransaction Selection Sets‚Äù to quickly retrieve transactions.
- View detailed transaction insights, including related data, without navigating away from the main interface.
- Expose APIs to support operations and third-party integrations.

## ‚úÖ High-Level System Design

### üéØ Goal
Establish the foundational **architecture**, **components**, and **technology stack** for building the backend of the Transaction Insight System.

### üìå Core System Components

| **Component**            | **Description**                                                                                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **API Gateway** _(Optional)_     | Routes incoming requests to appropriate microservices. Optional in the MVP phase.        |
| **Transaction Service**   | Core service for querying, filtering, and analyzing financial transactions.                    |
| **Selection Set Service** | Manages CRUD operations on Transaction Selection Sets (saved queries).                         |
| **Insight Service** _(Optional for MVP)_ | Provides detailed insights and related data for a transaction.                |
| **Authentication Service** _(Optional)_ | Handles JWT-based authentication and authorization if implemented.            |
| **Relational Database (PostgreSQL)** | Stores transactions and selection sets with optimized indexing for fast querying. |
| **Cache Layer (Redis)** _(Optional)_ | Caches frequently accessed data and optimizes query performance.             |
| **Logging and Monitoring** _(Planned)_ | Collects logs and monitors system health using logback/ELK/Prometheus.       |

### üìå Tech Stack Choices

| **Layer**       | **Technology**               |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| **Language**    | Java                         |
| **Framework**   | Spring Boot (Microservices)  |
| **API Design**  | REST (initial), GraphQL (optional later) |
| **Database**    | PostgreSQL                   |
| **Cache**       | Redis _(optional)_           |
| **Authentication** | JWT (Auth0 or Spring Security) _(optional)_ |
| **Testing**     | JUnit, Mockito               |
| **Containerization** | Docker                  |
| **Deployment (Optional)** | Docker Compose (local), Kubernetes (future phases) |
| **Documentation** | OpenAPI/Swagger            |
| **Version Control** | Git (feature/primary branch strategy) |

### üìå Microservices Breakdown

#### 1. Transaction Service
- Query and filter transactions.
- Supports paginated responses.
- Optimized search with indexed database fields.

#### 2. Selection Set Service
- Create, retrieve, update, and delete Transaction Selection Sets.
- Supports storage and reuse of saved filters/queries.

_(Insight Service and others can be modularized in future iterations)_

---

### üìå Data Flow Example
1. **Client (Postman/Frontend)** sends a **REST API** request to the **Transaction Service**.
2. Transaction Service processes the request, queries **PostgreSQL** (and optionally Redis cache).
3. Results are returned as **paginated API responses**.
4. Selection Sets can be saved/retrieved via the **Selection Set Service**, querying the database.

---

### üìå Containerization & Deployment Plan
- Each microservice will be packaged as an individual **Docker container**.
- Use **Docker Compose** for local development orchestration.
- Plan for **Kubernetes deployment** in future phases for scalability.
- Provide a **deployment guide** in the repository.

---

### üìå API Documentation Plan
- Document all REST APIs using **OpenAPI/Swagger**.
- Include API specs as part of the repository for easy testing and integration.

---

### üìå Assumptions & Trade-offs
- Authentication and caching are optional in the MVP and can be added in later iterations.
- REST APIs are prioritized for simplicity and easier Postman testing; GraphQL can be introduced as an enhancement.
- Docker is prioritized over Kubernetes in the early development stages for simplicity.
