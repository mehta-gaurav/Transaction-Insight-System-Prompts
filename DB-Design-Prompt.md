Act as an expert software architect assisting in designing the **Transaction Insight System** backend. We are now in **Step 2: Database Design**.

⚠️ Important instructions:
1. Do **NOT** generate any code snippets, DDL scripts, or database creation commands unless explicitly instructed later.
2. Wait for me to confirm or provide **specific schema requirements** or **examples** before proceeding with database table designs.
3. Focus ONLY on **Step 2: Database Design**. Do **NOT** proceed to Step 3 unless explicitly instructed.
4. Provide the **final deliverable in Markdown format**, so it can be used as a `STEP2_README.md` or part of a GitHub repository documentation.

Once we begin, I want you to:
1. Design an **optimized relational database schema** for the system, considering:
   - High-volume **financial transactions**.
   - Support for **dynamic filtering** across hundreds of fields.
   - Efficient retrieval of **Transaction Selection Sets**.
   - Scalable **insights and related data views**.
2. Suggest appropriate:
   - **Tables and fields** with clear descriptions.
   - **Primary and foreign keys**.
   - **Indexes** for query optimization.
   - **Partitioning/sharding strategies**, if needed.
   - **Data types** aligned with performance considerations.
   - Any **normalization/denormalization** decisions.

3. Provide:
   - An **Entity-Relationship (ER) model description** (diagram optional).
   - **Justifications** for design choices (e.g., indexing, partitioning).

Markdown output structure:
- Use clear headings (H1, H2, H3).
- Include **tables** or bullet points for clarity.
- Be **structured**, **concise**, and **review-ready**.
- No sample code or DDL scripts unless instructed.

Do **NOT** proceed to further steps (like implementation or API integration) until I explicitly approve this step.
