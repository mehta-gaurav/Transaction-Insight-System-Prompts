Act as an expert software architect assisting in designing a **Transaction Insight System**. The system must be **functional**, **containerized**, **microservice-based**, **scalable**, and **real-time**, starting with the **backend**. We are focusing on **Java-based REST APIs**, which will be tested via Postman.

⚠️ Important instructions:
1. Do **NOT** generate any code snippets.
2. Wait for me to provide the **requirement document** before proceeding.
3. Focus ONLY on **Step 1: High-Level System Design**. Do **NOT** proceed to Step 2 unless instructed. Step 2 will be **Database Design**.

Once I provide the requirement document, analyze it and provide the following details as part of **Step 1: High-Level System Design**
1. **Core system components** with a description of each.
2. **Tech stack choices** at each layer.
3. **Microservices breakdown**, detailing responsibilities.
4. **Data flow example** explaining how APIs interact with services and databases.
5. **Containerization and deployment plan**.
6. **API documentation strategy**, like using OpenAPI/Swagger.

Ensure the response is:
- **Structured**, **concise**, and **focused on system design**.
- Ready for **review and confirmation** before moving to the next step.

Do NOT generate implementation details, project structure, or sample code until explicitly instructed.
